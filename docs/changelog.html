<h1>OneFileCMS Change Log</h1>

<h3>v3.6.13 (2017-10-08)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Some code improvements. </li>
<li>$MESSAGE's from System_Setup() no longer reported on Login page, but are reported after login.</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.6.12 (2017-10-08)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Admin page now shows username OneFileCMS is running as.</li>
<li>Index &amp; Edit pages now indicate files that are not writable (rather than just responding with an error message after trying to edit/delete said files).</li>
<li>When editing file permissions, message box shows current expanded perms [rwxrwxrwx] owner group :current user: <br />
(But, can still only edit the octal form by the file name.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.6.11 (2017-10-06)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Switched to php short tags: <code>&lt;?= ?&gt;</code>&nbsp; &nbsp; (from <code>&lt;?php echo ?&gt;</code>) &nbsp; &nbsp; Because I felt like it.  I wanted to years ago, in my beginning of this project, but my web host was still on some 5.3 version of php, and didn't always have 'em enabled. But now, as php is up to v7.something, and most hosts have, at least, php 5.4, it seems like a safe move at this point.  If not, oh well!</li>
</ul>

<li>Fixed a couple bugs in keyboard navigation when there's only one item in current diretory.
(Couldn't "arrow up" when in the file row [M][C][D][x][perms] [Filename])
(It was submitting on enter when on checkboxes.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.6.04 (2017-09-20)</h3>

<ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a minor bug with tabindex on directory listing page.</li>
<li>Increased default $PRE_ITERATIONS from 1000 to 10000. Had kept low as IE8 was slow.</li>
<li>Now attempts to set a session_save_path() based on username. (default is /tmp, or /var/lib/php5/, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.6.01 (2017-09-18)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a couple of minor display bugs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.6 (2017-09-17)</h3>

</ul>

<h3>v3.5.19 (2016-06-16)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added line numbers to left of edit window.  A current side effect is wrapping is now break-word, instead of word-break.  That is, lines may wrap in the midddle of words, not just on white-space. </li>
<li>Added a word-wrap toggle option on the edit page.  Only works on editable files. Files with edit disabled still just word-wrap normally as appropriate.</li>

</ul>

<h3>v3.5.08 (2014-03-21)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Mostly just some code improvements/cleanup.</li>
<li>...and css...</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.5.07 (2014-03-15)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Removed ability for OneFileCMS to edit itself - it is too risky an option.  If needed, make a copy &amp; edit it.</li>

<li>Some general code improvements &amp; shuffling</li>
<li>Some CSS shuffling &amp; tweaks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.5.03 (2014-03-06)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Minor update to Get_DIRECTORY_DATA(). Didn't seem to affect all php versions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.5.02 (2014-03-06)</h3>

<ul>
<li>OneFileCMS can now work with non-ASCII filenames.</li>
<li>(But, OneFileCMS itself can not be named with non-ASCII characters. I don't know why.)</li>
<li>Increased $PRE_ITERATIONS from 200 to 1000.  This will affect, at least, older IE's, and maybe other browsers as well. For instance, it takes IE8 37 times longer to perform the "pre-iterations" than Firefox.  In anycase, it can, of course, be changed back if needed. <br />
(However, OneFileCMS does not currenly work in IE, so it's kinda academic for now.)</li>
<li>Some css tweaks &amp; improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.5.01 (2014-02-22)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Mostly behind the scenes stuff...</li>
<li>Replaced use of htmlentities() with htmlspecialchars().  With UTF-8, htmlentites() is superfluous.</li>
<li>Added hsc() to a number of strings where should have already been.</li>
<li>Changed directory sort function a bit. Note: when selecting/deselecting the 'folders first' option, the primary sort will be the last sorted column.</li>
<li>Split out a new function, Send_data_to_js(), from Index_Page().</li>
<li>Also, in prep for an upcoming update, tagged several places (with //##### ) where file system calls are made. The $filename strings used in the calls may need to be encoded with something other than UTF-8, depending on the underlying OS's filesystem. (such as NTFS, which uses UTF-16)</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.5 (2014-02-19)</h3>

<ul>
<li>The directory list can now be sorted by column: name, .ext, size, date.</li>
<li>Also has an option to list folders first, or to sort without regard to file or folder.</li>
<li>In accomplishing the above, most sorting moved client side.  This permits resorts without another server hit.</li>
<li>Added &amp; tweaked some css...</li>
<li>Slight restructure of the repo (ie: move a few "extras" files around).</li>
<li>NOTE:  versions 3.4.23 and later DO NOT WORK IN IE!  I don't know why yet, mostly likely js related.</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.4.23 (2014-02-12)</h3>

<ul>
<li>More changes in prep for sort by column</li>
<li>Directory list is now built &amp; displayed client side via javascript.</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.4.22 (2014-02-10)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Mostly some changes to prep for sort by column (name, size, or date) feature.</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.4.21 (2014-02-08)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added back the option for external style sheets</li>
<li>Cooresponding updates to sample external config file.</li>
<li>In addition to specific file names, specific folder names may now be excluded from directory listings.</li>
<li>Fixed minor missing page title on Copy Folder page</li>
<li>Tweaked a couple css defaults</li>
</ul>

<h3>(2013-01-19)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Just some minor updates/wording changes to the readme &amp; plugin/*.init files.</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.4.20 (2012-12-19)</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The $ACCESS_ROOT option has been reimplemented and is now fully functional*.  This option limits access to a specified folder (and it's sub-folders).  To use, just specify a valid path relative to the root of the website (no leading slash). <br />
(*Well, as best as I can tell...)</p></li>
<li><p>All OneFileCMS configuration variables that reference external files ($CONFIG_file, $LANGUAGE_FILE, $WYSIWYG_PLUGIN) must be specified in one of two ways:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Relative to the root of the website - with NO leading slash:  "some/path/from/webroot/somefile.php"  </li>
<li>Absolute to the file system - WITH a leading slash:  "/some/path/from/system/root/somefile.php" <br />
(On Windows, the drive letter may also be used, but it is not required if all is on same drive.)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.4.19 (2012-12-12)</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Slightly adjusted how wysiwyg plugins are implemented - removed $WYSIWIG_SOURCE config variable. <br />
(It's value is now specified directly in the "init" file specified by $WYSIWYG_PLUGIN.)</p></li>
<li><p>Two steps forward, one step back... <br />
Just for now - removed the $ACCESS_ROOT option.  I was coding in circles and getting no where while trying to reconcile various issues:  </p>

<ul>
<li>With OneFileCMS in any folder other than the web root,</li>
<li>With OneFileCMS in a folder other than $ACCESS_ROOT  </li>
<li>Depending on the above, can't delete the backup copy of OneFileCMS created by a p/w or u/n change).</li>
<li>External file references (config, language, plugins) affected by the above.  </li>
<li>Should $ACCESS_ROOT also restrict access to OneFileCMS itself?  That would prevent p/w &amp; u/n changes.</li>
<li>Display of the current/path/header/ varies depending on $ACESS_ROOT.</li>
<li>Combining the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>A solution is in the works, but I'm going to take some time to make sure no new problems are introduced by the eventual fix. (hahaha...) It will probably end up being simple, but it's not yet...</p></li>
<li><p>Just a general note on security: due to the fundamental structure of OneFileCMS - primarily that it's one file, and that there is no seperate database for authentication - there are certain inherent security limitations that should be kept in mind:  </p>

<ul>
<li>The first is that all OneFileCMS users are "admins", with the ability to upload and edit files with any type of code.</li>
<li>Next, as a direct consequence of the prior point, is that any restriction imposed by some potential feature, such as the $ACCESS_ROOT option that limited access to a specific folder, is only - at most - a guard against accidental access and modification of files outside of the "accessible" folder.   This is not to say that such features are not useful - this is simply meant to provide a realistic expectation of security, and that OneFileCMS should only be used with trusted users.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.4.18 (2012-12-03)</h3>

<p>Of course, everything comes with a price (exacerbated by my apparent lack of testing...)</p>

<ul>
<li>Anyway, the current release partly fixes an issue when trying to use a wysiwyg editor with onefilecms.php installed in a sub-folder of a site.  The issue is - it didn't work.  Now it does - mostly. However, there is still an issue using wysiwyg editors if the $ACCESS_ROOT variable is set to anything but blank (root).</li>
</ul>

<h3>2012-12-03</h3>

<ul>
<li>Just a note: there is an issue using a wysiwyg editor when onefilecm.php is in a sub-folder, or related to using the $ACCESS_ROOT option (restricting onefilecms access to a folder).  WYSIWYG seems to otherwise work fine when onefilecms.php is in the root folder of a site.</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.4.17 (2012-11-29)</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>WYSIWYG is here! <br />
Due to popular demand (ie: it has been requested more than once), WYSYWIG editors can now be "plugged in" and used with OneFileCMS.  Currently, only <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/">TinyMCE</a> and <a href="http://ckeditor.com/">CKEditor</a> have been tested (and on a very limited scale). Others may work - but I don't know yet.  And, naturally, the use or inclusion of such editors is completely optional, of course.</p>

<p><strong>No actual WYSIWYG editors are included with OneFileCMS</strong> - any desired editor must be obtained seperately.</p>

<p>A brief how-to on using either editor can be found in their respective sample "init" files included in the plugins folder of the OneFileCMS repo. Any suitable init file for a given editor may be used, as long as the correct path to the editor's javascript source file is specified, and - for CKEditor - the id of the OneFileCMS textarea, "file_editor", is also be specified. </p>

<p>Now, while everything seems to work, I have little to no experience using TinyMCE, CKEditor, or any other such application. So, if there is something missing or not working as expected, please let me know (open an "issue" on the Issues page).</p>

<p>Notes:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>These editors have their own, extensive, event controls (responses to keyboard &amp; mouse input), so the OneFileCMS edit page event scripts are not loaded when an editor is in use.  The primary effect is the loss of incidental file status indicators - [Save] will not change to [SAVE CHANGES!], background color will not change, etc., and any "unsaved changes" alerts should be handled by the active editor.  Also, the [Wide View] button will be unavailable.  </p></li>
<li><p>The TinyMCE "init" file included in the OneFileCMS repo specifies the use of the TinyMCE "fullpage" plugin, which produces an "unsaved changes" alert every time you exit the Edit page - even if no changes have been made to the file in the editor.  </p></li>
<li><p>The CKEditor, on the other hand, does not seem to present an alert at all when you leave the editor page - even with unsaved changes.  </p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.4.16 (2012-11-23)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added icons to lower buttons on edit page.</li>
<li>And a few code tweaks &amp; improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h3>v3.4.15 (2012-11-18)</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Added client-side hashing of passwords. 
This is primarily a benefit for the user, as it does not really add any security to the server side application that uses it (such as OneFileCMS).  The reason is that this "pre-hash" simply becomes the actual password as far as the server is concerned, and is just as vulnerable to exposure while in transit. However, it does help to protect the user's plain-text password, which may be used elsewhere.  </p></li>
<li><p>Also added a "please wait..." message while computing the client-side hashes - primarily for IE versions &lt; 9, which are MUCH slower than FF or Chrome (by a factor of 37 or more).  Subsequently, the number of iterations for the client-side hashing is quite low (compared to the server side), but still causes a 1 - 2 second delay on the login screen, and a 3 - 6 second delay on the Change Password screen.  On FF and Chrome, however, the delay is much shorter, almost unnoticable.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to thank <a href="http://github.com/fermuch">fermuch</a> for the client-side hashing suggestion.  While a somewhat different approach was ultlimately employed, his original solution provided the insight needed to approach the idea in general.</p></li>
</ul>
