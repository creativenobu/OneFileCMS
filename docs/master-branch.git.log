    Version 3.6.11
    - Switched to php short tags: <?= ?>.  Because I felt like it.  I wanted to years ago, in the beginning, but my web host was still on some 5.3 version of php, and didn't always have 'em enabled. But now that php is up to v7.something, and most hosts have, at least, php 5.4, it seems like a safe move at this point.  If not, oh well!

    Gave #message_box a min height on all pages for visual consistancy and so pages
      don't jump as much when #message_box is closed.

Date:   Thu Mar 6 13:01:00 2014 -0500

    Version 3.5.02
    OneFileCMS can now work with non-ASCII filenames:
      Replaced str_******() function calls with their mb_ versions.
      All file system calls (is_file(), file_get_contents, etc...) use $filenames
      converted to filesystem encoding (usually ASCII/UTF-8, but not on always)
      (And actually, only Windows is checked for currenly, else defaults to UTF-8)
    (But, OneFileCMS can not be named with non-ASCII characters. I don't know why.)
    Added Sort_and_Show() js function.
    General improvements to Get_DIRECTORY_DATA(), Index_Page(), Upload_response(),
     CRM_, MCD_, & related functions.
    Renamed Send_data_to_js() to Send_data_to_js_and_display()
    Improved check for optional external files ($CONFIG_FILE, etc...)
    Removed is_empty(). Hasn't been used since v3.4.06
    Moved validate_units() out of System_Startup(), even tho it's only used there.
    Renamed oridinalize() to add_serial_num().
    New: Convert_encoding() - wrapper for mb_convert_encoding()
    Adjusted wording of $_['mcd_msg_0?'], ? = 1,2, &3
    Some css tweaks & improvements.
    Increased $PRE_ITERATIONS from 200 to 1000. This will affect older IE,
    and maybe other browsers. It can, of course, be changed back it needed.

    Version 3.5.01
    
    Switched all use of hte() to hsc(). hte() is superfluous with UTF-8.
    Updated comments about hsc() & hte()
    On innHTML = <?php echo addslashes($value) ?>, switched addslashes() to hsc().
    System_Setup(): added function validate_units($cssvalue).  Just because.
    $_['ext']: changed from just 'ext' to  '.ext';
    New: $_['folders_first_info']
    Added hsc() where needed in a few places.
    New: function Send_data_to_js().  Split out from Index_Page().
    Get_DIRECTORY_DATA(): check if file_exists() in case of encoding error.
    Index_Page_scripts(): changed some js CONSTANTS & flags for sort_DIRECTORY().
    sort_DIRECTORY(): Changed logic. A little more verbose, but seems clearer.
    In prep for an upcoming bug fix:
      added $ENC_OS, $ENC_UA, and $CLIENT_OS
      Also, tagged several places (with //##### ) where file system calls are made.
      The $filename strings used in the calls may need to be encoded with something
      other than UTF-8, depending on the underlying OS's filesystem.
        (such as NTFS, which uses UTF-16)

    3.24.23 & 3.4.24 DO NOT WORK IN IE!

    New: $_['ext']            = 'ext';  // filename.ext(ension)
    New: $_['folders_first']  = 'folders first';
    New text "icons": $ICONS['dir'] = '[+]'; $ICONS['folder'] = '[+]';
    Index_Page(): get dir list, don't sort server side, but filter . & ..
    Create_Table_for_Listing(): Added <a>'s & onclicks for sort calls
    Create_Table_for_Listing(): Also switched from all echo "...", to direct html
      (except for a few echo's...)
    Get_DIRECTORY_DATA(): improved determination of $ext.
    Get_DIRECTORY_DATA(): added DIRECTORY_DATA[x][5] = $ext (for client side sort)
    Index_Page_scripts(): added a few global js variables for client side sorting.
                New ()'s: Sort_Folders_First(), sort_DIRECTORY()
    Display_Directory_Summary(): insert via innerHTML instead of document.write.
    Added some css for the directory header & footer rows.

    Version 3.3.07

    Version 3.3.06
    An external $config_file is now simply a php file (was an ini).
      So, now uses include($config_file) instead of parse_ini_file($config_file).
    Added some comments for $config_file
    Increased hash iterations from 1000 to 10000.
      (I've read that lots of iterations help slow down brute force p/w recovery)
    Updated hash for default "password".
    Created Page_Header() & moved <div class=header> code to it.
    show_favicon(): now returns string instead of echo'ing it.
    Upload_response(): changed $_['bytes_01'] (it wasn't defined) to $_['meta_txt_02'].

    style_sheet(): Set width of input type="text" to 99.5%
    Adjusted css for label
    A couple of minor text spacing improvements.

    1)Corrected "../" link.  It was only linking to first level, no matter how deep the current folder.
    2)Modified "path/to/current/folder" so that each level is click-able directly to that folder.
